Introduction Essay



The first computer experience that I can remember took place a long time ago, back in 2002 at 6 years old. My family had this old IBM machine with that pervasive 90’s dingey yellow-beige plastic and a CRT monitor. I was fascinated by things like Email, and my favorite game; Oregon Trail. I took apart the computer to see what made it work inside, and with my mother’s help we put it back together and got it to work again. My major is in computer science, and I have taken Comp Sci 1+2, Discrete Mathematics, Web Page Design and Digital Logic Fundamentals. I haven’t made any important or large programs or been a part of a project that I wasn’t assigned outside of class. I am not a very creative person, but I am a quick study. 



I visualize implementing the skills I will learn from Web Programming to hopefully get gainful employment, and to launch my own website that will impress even other Web Programmers. 





The picture I included is from yesterday when my rear tyre blew up on my way to school, but I was fortunate enough to get good service from everyone who I depended on, and got to class on time!
